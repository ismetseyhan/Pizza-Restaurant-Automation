INTRODUCTION / AIM

The aim of this experiment is to introduce you object-oriented programming and design with Java. You will learn the structure of a class, how classes interact, inheritance and polymorphism and basic input-output operations in Java. There will be two main parts to this assignment. One part consists of creating the system’s input-output interface and implementing the logic for this interaction. The other part is defining (and implementing) the persistence backend (i.e. how we store and retrieve the information our system uses). You should also use decorator design pattern in first part of the experiment. Your homework will take commands from an input file then it will print the results of these commands to an output file. You should use Data Access Objects (DAO) to manage your data.


javac Main.java 
java Main input.txt customer.txt order.txt

 INPUT

The paths of the input files will be provided as command line arguments in the order of

<input.txt><customer.txt><order.txt>

 OUTPUT The program automatically creates the output file <output.txt>
